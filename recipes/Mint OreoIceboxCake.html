            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This decadent OREO icebox cake is incredibly easy to make and requires only six ingredients. It’s a perfect
                dessert for kids’ birthday parties that doesn’t require heating up the kitchen. As is, this cooling cake offers
                a delightful mint-chocolate flavor profile, but feel free to switch things up by using your favorite OREO cookie
                flavor–just leave out the fresh mint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 cup confectioners sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
                <li>7 mint chocolate sandwich cookies, such as Mint OREO Chocolate Sandwich Cookies</li>
                <li>18 thin mint chocolate sandwich cookies, such as OREO Thins Chocolate Sandwich Cookies, Mint Flavored Creme,
                    divided</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chocolate syrup</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat heavy cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment on medium-high speed for 2
                    minutes. Add powdered sugar, and beat until stiff peaks form. Place 3/4 cup whipped cream, covered, in the
                    refrigerator to use later for topping. Stir chopped mint into remaining whipped cream.</li>
                <li>Line an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap. Remove tops of the 7 Oreo Cookies, and discard tops.
                    Shingle cookies, green filling side down, along the center of the prepared pan. Spread half of the mint
                    whipped cream in an even layer over the cookies.</li>
                <li>Roughly chop 12 of the Oreo Thins, and sprinkle evenly over whipped cream. Spread remaining mint whipped
                    cream evenly over chopped cookies.</li>
                <li>Cut remaining 6 Oreo Thins in half; place cookie halves on top of mint whipped cream, aligning straight cut
                    edges of cookies with edges of the pan. Fold plastic wrap over cake, and freeze for at least 8 hours. </li>
                <li>To serve, peel plastic wrap from top of cake; invert cake onto a serving plate, remove and discard plastic
                    wrap. Drizzle with chocolate syrup, and top with reserved whipped cream. Garnish with fresh mint, and more
                    cookies if desired.</li>
            </ol>
