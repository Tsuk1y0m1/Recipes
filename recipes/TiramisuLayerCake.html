        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 large egg whites</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frosting Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Garnish Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) square semisweet chocolate</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch pans.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Beat cake mix, water, egg whites, and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed
            until well combined, about 2 minutes. Divide 2/3 of the batter between 2 prepared pans. Stir instant coffee
            into remaining batter; pour into the remaining prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cakes comes out clean, 23 to 28
            minutes. Cool cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Make syrup: Combine brewed coffee and coffee liqueur in a measuring cup; set aside.</li>
        <li>Make filling: Beat mascarpone, confectioners' sugar, and coffee liqueur in a medium bowl with an electric
            mixer on low speed until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to keep cool.</li>
        <li>Make frosting: Beat cream, confectioners' sugar, and coffee liqueur in a medium bowl with an electric mixer
            on medium-high speed until stiff. Fold 1/2 cup frosting into chilled filling until combined. Store frosting
            and filling, covered, in the refrigerator to keep cool.</li>
        <li>Assemble cake: Place 1 plain cake layer on a serving plate. Using a thin skewer, poke holes in cake, about 1
            inch apart. Pour 1/3 of the coffee syrup over cake, then cover with 1/2 of the filling. Top with
            coffee-flavored cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour another 1/3 of the coffee syrup over cake and cover
            with remaining filling. Top with remaining cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour remaining coffee syrup on
            top. Spread sides and top of cake with frosting.</li>
        <li>Garnish cake: Place cocoa powder in a sieve and lightly dust top of cake. Run a vegetable peeler down the
            edge of chocolate square to form curls. Scatter chocolate curls over cake.</li>
        <li>Chill cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
